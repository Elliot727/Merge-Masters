Merge-Masters

Merge-Masters is a fun and addictive puzzle game inspired by the popular game 2048. Built using SwiftUI, Merge-Masters offers a refreshing and visually appealing experience for players of all ages.

Gameplay
The objective of Merge-Masters remains the same: combine numbered tiles on a grid to reach the coveted tile with the number 2048. However, in this version, you'll encounter additional elements that spice up the gameplay. Here's a breakdown of the features:

Shop
The shop feature allows players to utilize in-game currency to purchase power-ups and static tiles. Visit the shop to enhance your gameplay experience and unlock new possibilities.

Power-ups
2X Multiplier: Activate this power-up to double the value of the merged tiles for a limited duration. Use it strategically to boost your score and reach higher numbers quickly.
Bomb: Need to clear a tile from the grid? The bomb power-up comes to your rescue. Use it to remove a specific tile and create space for new merges.
Shuffle Board: Feeling stuck? Activate the shuffle board power-up to randomly rearrange the tiles on the grid. It might just give you the fresh start you need to make those big merges.
Swap 2 Tiles: Sometimes, a single tile stands in the way of a massive merge. With the swap 2 tiles power-up, you can exchange the positions of two tiles on the grid, allowing for new opportunities and combinations.
Portal: Randomly spawn a tile with a random value into an empty tile
Static Tiles
In addition to the numbered tiles, Merge-Masters introduces static tiles that add an extra layer of complexity and strategy to the game:

Forest: The forest tile represents a lush green area. It doesn't merge or move but serves as an obstacle on the grid. Plan your moves carefully to work around these static tiles.
Portal (to be implemented): The portal tile is a mysterious element that transports nearby tiles to other locations on the grid. Utilize this feature to your advantage and create unexpected merges.
Water Tile: The water tile downgrades the value of any tile it collides with by half. Be cautious of its presence and adjust your strategy accordingly.
Lava Tile: The lava tile is destructive and destroys any tile it collides with. Avoid it at all costs, as it can hinder your progress.
